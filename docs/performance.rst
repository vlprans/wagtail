Performance
===========

Wagtail is designed for speed, both in the editor interface and on the front-end, but if you want even better performance or you need to handle very high volumes of traffic, here are some tips on eking out the most from your installation.

Editor interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have tried to minimise external dependencies for a working installation of Wagtail, in order to make it as simple as possible to get going. However, a number of default settings can be configured for better performance:

Cache
-----

We recommend `Redis <http://redis.io/>`_ as a fast, persistent cache. Install Redis through package manager and enable it as a cache backend::

	CACHES = {
	    'default': {
	        'BACKEND': 'redis_cache.cache.RedisCache',
	        'LOCATION': '127.0.0.1:6379',
	        'OPTIONS': {
	            'CLIENT_CLASS': 'redis_cache.client.DefaultClient',
	        }
	    }
	}

Without a persistent cache, Wagtail will recreate all compressable assets at each server start, e.g. when any files change under ```./manage.py runserver```.

Search
------

Wagtail has strong support for `Elasticsearch <http://www.elasticsearch.org/>`_ - both in the editor interface and for users of your site - but can fall back to a database search if Elasticsearch isn't present. Elasticsearch is faster and more powerful than the Django ORM for text search, so we recommend installing it or using a hosted service like `Searchly <http://www.searchly.com/>`_.

Database
--------

Wagtail is tested on SQLite, and should work on other Django-supported database backends, but we recommend PostgreSQL for production use.

Caching proxy
-------------

To support high volumes of traffic with excellent response times, we recommend a caching proxy. Both `Varnish <http://www.varnish-cache.org/>`_ and `Squid <http://www.squid-cache.org/>`_ have been tested in production. Hosted proxies like `Cloudflare <https://www.cloudflare.com/>`_ should also work well.
